This directory contains the following m-files:
-- AV_Matlab_SW_IEEE_CSM: This contains the m-file used to creat all images in the IEEE CSM article. 
-- AV_Python: This contains python a python implementation of a set of tools for developing and testing methods to develop a state-space model for the IMU output stochastic error from the Allan variance parameters.
-- IEEECSMPreprintASDTutorial.pdf is a preprint of the article: J. A. Farrell, F. O. Silva, F. Rahman, and J. Wendel, “Inertial
measurement unit error modeling tutorial: Inertial navigation system state estimation with real-time sensor calibration,” IEEE Control Systems Magazine, vol. 42, no. 6, pp. 40–66, 2022. Downloading the actual article is recommended. It has a much better page layout.
